    properties: {content: Metaphor can be briefly defined as thinking of one thing (A) as though it were another thing (B). A is known as the TARGET and B is known as the SOURCE. When expressed in language this results in items of vocabulary being applied in an unusual or new way. For instance in, spacing_above: none, spacing_below: none, role: justify-text}

      content: "“a foreign country” (SOURCE) is unusually applied to or equated with “the past” (TARGET).\n\n\n\nA similarity between SOURCE and TARGET, justifying the \"as though\", is provided by \"they do things differently there\". \n\n\n\nIn 1980 George Lakoff and Mark Johnson published the book Metaphors We Live By. This popularised the theory that thought and language are impossible without metaphor and employ metaphors all the time. For instance the last sentence uses the words “employs” and “without” metaphorically. The evidence for the importance of metaphor in language and thought comes from patterns of vocabulary which have found their way into the dictionary. These are labelled according to the formula TARGET IS SOURCE. For instance consider this table which shows some of the metaphorical vocabulary under the metaphor theme UNDERSTAND IS HOLD/GRASP.\n"

        As metaphor depends upon similarity or analogy, the relationship between sources provides an analogy for the relationship between targets.



        I felt a need for a thorough investigation of how metaphors are organised in the vocabulary of English. So, beginning in 1999, I undertook a research project on The Metaphorical Structure of the Lexicon funded by the Hong Kong SAR government. I collected metaphorical data (9000+ lexical items) from dictionaries and thesauruses of contemporary English (CoBUILD, Encarta, Cambridge International Dictionary of English, Deignan 1995, Wilkinson 2002) and categorised them according to patterns called METAPHOR THEMES and subthemes (also known as root analogies or conceptual metaphor themes), and provided word-class data for the vocabulary and examples of its use. This online Thesaurus gives access to the data.

        Please note that this does not claim to be a definitive list of all the lexicalised metaphors in English, even were that possible given the open-ended nature of lexicography. In fact, the data assembled here was an attempt to discover which metaphor themes or conceptual metaphors could be regarded as cognitively important, using as evidence the number of lexical items that belong to that metaphor theme and the frequency of their occurrence in a general corpus (at the time the CoBUILD one). This means that lexicalised metaphors that could not be allocated to these important metaphor themes would be excluded.
