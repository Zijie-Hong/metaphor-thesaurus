      3. Search by Target. Any Target in the list can be entered. The search result gives all the Metaphor Themes with that Target. Again, clicking on them will give access to the Metaphor Theme page (see above)

      4. Search by Source. Similarly, any Source in the list can be entered. The search result gives all the Metaphor Themes with that Source. Again, clicking on them will give access to the Metaphor Theme page (see above)

  properties: {content: 'The first three verb types are intransitive because none of them has a direct object. However, 2 and 3 could be thought to have an indirect object since the preposition at the end of them is followed by a noun. 4 has both a direct object and a kind of indirect object following the preposition. 5 has a direct object but is followed by an adverb (therefore has no indirect object). Type 6 differs from type 5 in that the word order is optional -- ''I could knock a short article together for you'' is just as acceptable and in cases of a pronoun as object this latter word order is obligatory. This is why it is classified as a transitive verb. Often there are subtle variations in sub-categorisation of word-class from literal to metaphorical meanings.'}

      This page is designed to allow users to review, edit, or delete suggestions.

      To review, users can click on the 'Review' button at the right of the card and open the form after password verification. The details of the suggested item can be modified, and the theme it belongs to can be chosen as well by specifying Target, Source, and sub theme via dropdown menus.

      A suggestion can be removed from the list by clicking on the 'Delete' button and verifying the password. Considering that the entry is permanently removed, secondary confirmation is added for users to avoid mis-operation.
